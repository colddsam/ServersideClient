## Running Tests

To run tests, use the localhost of your machine, I used live server for it 

```bash
  http://127.0.0.1:5500/
```


## Deployment

To deploy this first made the necessary changes on the template, then run the following

Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
  npm install -g vercel
```
Navigate to your project directory:
```bash
  cd /path/to/your/project
```
Login to your Vercel account (if not already logged in):
```bash
  vercel login
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to log in to your Vercel account.

```bash
  vercel
```
This command will initiate the deployment process. Vercel will prompt you with some configuration options, such as setting up the project name, environment variables, etc. Follow the prompts to configure your deployment.

If you want to deploy without being prompted, you can use the --confirm flag:
```bash
  vercel --confirm
```
After a successful deployment, Vercel will provide you with a unique URL for your project. You can open this URL in your browser to view your deployed application.

Additionally, you can add a build command to specify how your project should be built before deployment. This is useful for projects that require build steps.
```bash
  vercel --build "your-build-command"
```
Replace "your-build-command" with the actual build command for your project.
